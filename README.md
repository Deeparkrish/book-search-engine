Saved books are stored in their account, so next time they login,the user can view them on a button click .
##  Technologies:
MongoDB Express.js React.js  Node.js GraphQL 
 * GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with the existing data, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need    and nothing more. 
 * Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client, the client will use in      their MERN application. The apollo-server-express  is used package to integrate GraphQL into Express.js server, and the @apollo/client package to make requests from the React front end to the GraphQL API.
 * React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with the application, allowing you to make a single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications. 
 * Concurrently npm package allows you to run multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface. Rather than opening multiple terminals to start the multiple servers, you can run them both at the same time. It also allows you to keep track of different outputs in one place, and will stop all of the processes if even one of them fails.
 * JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs, are an alternative to using session cookies for authentication. 
 * jwt-decode is an npm package that helps decode JWTs from their Base64Url encoding. You’ll use it to extract non-sensitive data such as the token’s expiration date to see if it’s expired before making a request to the server.
 * The faker is a npm package allows you to generate massive amounts of fake data in the development environment of  Node.js applications.
 * The nodemon package simplifies the development environment by automatically restarting Node.js applications when file changes in the directory are detected.
